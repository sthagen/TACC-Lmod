Here are notes for the 2/14 meeting

* CheckSyntax module
** Useful when generating modules.
* Quick review: How Lmod evaluates Module commands
* module --checkSyntax load 3.7
* TACC uses this when building modules in RPM *.spec files
*** Show example

* The command check_module_tree_syntax
* What is check_module_tree_syntax
** Report syntax errors in a site's moduletree
** Check for multiple ways to mark a default
   In other words, a directory that has both a default symlink and a
   .version file will be reported.
* Brief history:
** A site complained that they wanted a way to find module directories that contained multiple marked defaults
** They wanted a message when loading that module defualt it would produced a message to the user.
** I refused to report site issues (or errors) when ever possible.
** Always wanted a way to check syntax quickly.
** The spider command shouldn't report warning and errors to users.
   After all what are they suppose to do with this info
* Modify $LMOD_DIR/spider to walk the tree and report syntax errors
* Modified the spider cache format to have defaultA as well as defaultT
  rather than only keeping the marked default that will be used.
* Only try to find errors that pertain to the module in question
** Ignore things that would require more that the current module: load() etc.
** Use the MC_CheckSyntax rules for modulefile evaluation.
** ignore load(), depends_on() etc.
